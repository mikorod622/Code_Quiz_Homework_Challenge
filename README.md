# Code Quiz Homework Challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation making this project was to learn how to do more with javascript by making more complex applications. I built this project to make a quiz based on code themed questions. The problem that it solved was to make a quiz that you can input a custom questions.js file for with stored data that saves scores. I learned how to use a javascript file to access other javascript files and their data.
